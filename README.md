# Game Audio – Footstep SFX (Wood & Stone)

This repository contains a short footstep sound effect that I created during a game audio class at my university (Collegium Da Vinci, 2nd semester).

The recording combines footsteps on a **wooden bridge** and a **stone path**, designed as a game-ready SFX asset.

## Context

- Created as part of an **audio for games** course.
- The goal was to design a clear and believable footstep sound for two different surfaces.
- Prepared for use in a game engine / audio middleware (FMOD).

## File

- `footsteps_wood_bridge_stone_path.m4a` – final rendered audio file.

## Tools used

- FMOD Studio (basic use for game audio).
- Audio editing tools available during the class.

## How this could be used in a game

- Assigned as a footstep SFX for a character walking on:
  - wooden bridges / docks,
  - stone roads or paths.
- Could be extended into a full system with:
  - random pitch variations,
  - multiple variations per surface,
  - separate layers for different materials.
